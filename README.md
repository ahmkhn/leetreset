# LeetReset

An extension that deletes all solutions to solved problems on LeetCode.

I made this because previously I would have to hide my screen with my hand then click the 'reset' button which was annoying. (When re-solving a problem)

Extension simply deletes all local storage except your language preference.

I don't think this will work if you have LeetCode premium as then the solutions are stored on the cloud. :(
